# Create a script that gets the full name, balance, expense, and active loan balance of a customer
# Calculate and print the balance after the expense.
# If the customer spends from the loan, then tell about it.
# Add one more input, which asks about a new expense. If yes, continue inputting; if no, stop inputting.
# Stop inputting if the customer spends the whole balance and the loan
# Change the code to save the balance and loan in lists after each expense
# Change the code to use a list for saving the expenses
# Use the lists to print the necessary data
# Refactor code to use at least two types of data structures for working with data:
# For example: Expenses as a dictionary, Initial balances as tuples
